## Quick check: Node.js version

```bash
$ node -v
v24.11.0
$ npm -v
11.6.1
```

If you need to install Node, see [Basics Requirements](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-workshop-basics#requirements) and 📹 [Install Node and Cypress](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09KbTRLrgWA)

## Quick check: versions

You can use [available-versions](https://github.com/bahmutov/available-versions) NPM package to quickly list the published package versions.

```
$ npx available-versions cypress
...
13.13.3                     a month
13.14.0                     a month
13.14.1                     25 days
13.14.2                     19 days    latest, dev

$ npx available-versions playwright
...
1.47.1                      10 days
1.47.2                      3 days     latest
```

**Try it:** check the current latest Cy and Pw versions

## Release frequency

- Cypress https://on.cypress.io/changelog
- Playwright https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases

---

## Playwright files

- clone repo `https://github.com/bahmutov/cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc`

In the folder with [bahmutov/cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc](https://github.com/bahmutov/cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc) repo

```
$ git checkout files
$ npm install
$ npx playwright install
```

+++

## inspect Playwright files

Playwright installation creates:

- `playwright.config.js`
- `pw/example.spec.js`

Let's look at each file 👀

+++

## 💡 Pro tip

Normally you would scaffold Playwright files using a wizard

```shell
$ npm init playwright@latest
```

+++

## Todo: use 1 browser

Modify the PW config to only execute tests a single browser

+++

## Todo: test the local app using Playwright

**Important:** start the application in the separate terminal

💡 Start Playwright in [UI mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-ui-mode) `npx playwright test --ui` while modifying the spec file.

+++

- modify the `pw/example.spec.js`
- have a single test that:
  1. visits `localhost:3000`
  2. confirms the page title

**Tip:** look up test command by `npx playwright help` and `npx playwright <command> help`

+++

```js
// @ts-check
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test')

test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
  // visit the page "localhost:3000"
  // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
})
```

Note:

```js
// solution

// pw/example.spec.js
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test')

test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
  // visit the page "localhost:3000"
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/')

  // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle('cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc')
})
```

+++

## Playwright Test

```js
// pw/example.spec.js
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test')

test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
  // visit the page "localhost:3000"
  await page.goto('http://localhost:3000/')

  // Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle('cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc')
})
```

**Question:** do you get IntelliSense when hovering over `test` and `expect`?

+++

## Report vs Trace

- run the test and look at the test report
- run the test with a trace and look at the test report

Note:
Execute the above single spec with `npx playwright test` then `npx playwright show-report`. Run the test with trace on `npx playwright test --trace on`.

---

## Todo: inspect Cypress files

Look at the Cypress project files

- `cypress.config.js`
- `cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js`

+++

## 💡 Pro tip

Normally you would scaffold Cypress files by opening Cypress in the new project for the first time

![Cypress scaffold files](./img/start2.png)

+++

### How to open Cypress

```shell
npx cypress open
# or
yarn cypress open
# or
$(npm bin)/cypress open
# or
./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
```

+++

## Cypress files and folders

- "cypress.config.js" - all Cypress settings
- "cypress/e2e" - end-to-end test files (specs)
- "cypress/fixtures" - mock data <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "cypress/support" - shared commands, utilities <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Read blog post [Cypress is just ...](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-is/)

Note:
This section shows how Cypress scaffolds its files and folders. Then the students can ignore this folder. This is only done once to show the scaffolding.

---

## 💡 Pro tip

```shell
# quickly scaffolds Cypress folders
$ npx @bahmutov/cly init
# bare scaffold
$ npx @bahmutov/cly init -b
# typescript scaffold
$ npx @bahmutov/cly init --typescript
```

---

## First Cypress spec

Modify the spec `cypress/e2e/spec.cy.js`

```js
// @ts-check
/// <reference types="cypress" />

it('has title', () => {
  // visit the page "localhost:3000"
  // https://on.cypress.io/visit
  // the page title should have text "cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc"
  // https://on.cypress.io/title
})
```

💡 Run the test while editing the spec with `npx cypress open`

**Important:** start the application in the separate terminal

Note:

```js
it('has title', () => {
  // visit the page "localhost:3000"
  // https://on.cypress.io/visit
  cy.visit('http://localhost:3000/')

  // the page title should have text "cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc"
  // https://on.cypress.io/title
  cy.title().should('equal', 'cy-vs-pw-example-todomvc')
})
```

+++

## Run Cypress test

Cypress is really geared towards either working on the specs or running them headlessly

```
$ npx cypress open
$ npx cypress run
$ npx cypress help <command>
```

Run your spec headlessly.

🤔 How do you see what the test is doing?

+++

## Cypress: pick a browser

![Cypress browser switcher](./img/switch-browser.png)

+++

## Enable videos

```js
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    video: true
  }
})
```

💡 Screenshots are taken automatically on failures

---

## IntelliSense

- look at the `///` comment. This tells your code editor about Cypress globals like `cy`
- the comment `// @ts-check` tells your code editor to show any type mismatches in the specs

**Question:** why do we need to "explain" to Cypress the types? How is this different from Playwright? Take a look at https://github.com/bahmutov/local-cypress

---

## Docs and help

- Cypress documentation is at https://docs.cypress.io/
- Playwright documentation is at https://playwright.dev/docs/intro

When starting, read the introductions and the guides. Then consult the API docs as necessary.

+++

## Chat and support

- https://aka.ms/playwright/discord
- https://on.cypress.io/discord

+++

## 💡 Pro tip

```text
https://on.cypress.io/<command>
```

The above URL goes right to the documentation for that command.

## 🏁 Conclusions

- use the config file
- which browser?
- headed vs headless mode
- documentation is there
